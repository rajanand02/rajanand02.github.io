Being a distro hopper i switch distros often and i really enjoy it but the main problems are installing all the required applications,setting up the work environment,configure my editor etc..i have to spend at-least half a day to make it work the way i wanted..

It was fine when i tried to hack around all the distros back in my college days but after starting my own applications or working for other projects i can't really spend half of my productive day in setting up my distro so i decided to document all my configurations, settings and tweaks that would help me when i switch to another distro or probably a new version of Ubuntu itself and at the same time it might help others to make their installations real quick and easy..

#### Terminator
    
The first thing i always install in my fresh Ubuntu is [Terminator](https://launchpad.net/terminator)..
Terminator is a terminal emulator that has so may cool feature like multiple session in a single tab..
